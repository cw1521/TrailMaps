It holds up well to rain. There are some new sections which were just recently cut, they are still a bit spongy, but should firm up in time. Expect an hour and a half unless you are some kind of NORBA animal. I heard that some guy on a Rocky Mountain full suspension bike did the whole loop in One hour and ten minutes. All I gotta say is wow!",

        <description>The trails are very limited, and excellent for families. One set of trails shares with a frisbee golf course. Excellent for the beginner just wanting to strech his/her legs for the first time.</description>
        <directions>Take I-65 to Airport Blvd. West. Go approx. 6 miles to Hillcrest Road, turn left. Go approx. 3 mils and cross Grelot Road. The park is on the left just after the intersection.</directions>

        <description>•currently closed for renovations Jan 2022-UTC•\n\nThe best place to ride within a hundred miles. Short steep climbs, with the occaisional sand section. It holds up well to rain. There are some new sections which were just recently cut, they are still a bit spongy, but should firm up in time. Expect an hour and a half unless you are some kind of NORBA animal. I heard that some guy on a Rocky Mountain full suspension bike did the whole loop in One hour and ten minutes. All I gotta say is wow!</description>
        <directions>I-65 to three-mile exit, follow signs to Chickasabogue Park. Have one dollar ready and check direction of ride at park office.</directions>
